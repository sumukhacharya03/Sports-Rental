# Sports Equipment Rental Management System

# About the Project:

Sports Equipment Rental Management System, a web-based application designed to streamline the rental process of sports equipment within university settings. The system allows students to browse, select, and rent various sports equipment from a centralized database, while also tracking the availability of each item in real time. The database is managed by an admin, who has the ability to oversee and update equipment availability, ensuring an efficient and smooth experience for both users and administrators. The system's database is structured around key entities, including student, equipment, rental, admin, and availability, each modelled as a table to store relevant data. This ensures efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information related to equipment, rentals, and user interactions. The platform provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities through an intuitive web interface, allowing seamless interaction with the database and enhancing the overall equipment rental experience for students and administrators alike.
